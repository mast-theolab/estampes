"""Submodule of the parser related to Gaussian files for ESTAMPES

A module providing the submodules to be used by ESTAMPES:

Sub-modules
-----------
fchk
    Formatted checkpoint files.
glog
    Gaussian output files.

See submodules for details.

The module also provides some conversion functions specific to
Gaussian, which apply to different types, like the structure of electric
quadrupole moment

    """Convert electric quadrupole from LT form to 2D tensor.

    Gaussian has a particular way to store internally the electric
    quadrupole, with the following sequence:
    XX, YY, ZZ, XY, XZ, YZ.
    The function builds a list of lists with the correct order.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vec
        Vector of data corresponding to the sequence stored in memory.
        Note that the list can have a longer size, only the first
        elements are used.
