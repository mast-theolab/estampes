# Changelog

This file documents the changes to the ESTAMPES API and the associated tools.

ESTAMPES API is divided in 3 components:
- **API**: core API, in submodules `base`, `parser`.  Can work with a pure Python installation.  `NumPy` may be needed for higher-level capabilities
- **LIB**: library tools and physical databases complementing **API**.  Most capabilities are implemented on top of Python's core features.  Dependency on `NumPy` can be present when coupled with high-level core APIs.
- **VIZ**: visualization API.  It depends on visualization library, like `Qt` or `Matplotlib`

Tools have each one their own trigram
- **APP**: Estampes Suite Program (new program)\
- **2XY**: _ToXY_
- **BLS**: _Ballast_
- **BRS**: _Bars_
- **CRS**: _Corsairs_
- **ESP**: _ESParser_
- **MRG**: _Mirage_
- **OAR**: _Soar_
- **GUI**: Main graphical interface

Other blocks are:
- **ETC**: Miscellaneous features
- **DOC**: Documentation
- **DEV**: Development conventions/cleanup

## [0.6.0] - 2025-02-16

### Important
1. The logic in the POV-Ray description scene has been changed in this version to better match the interactive visualizer.  This means that the Z axis is now the vertical and Y points toward the camera, while the old previous, standard form was to have Y upwards and Z pointing in the direction opposite to the camera.  Note that to keep operations more intuitive, the left-handed representation is fully maintained.

### Added
- **2XY**: New simple script to generate convoluted band-shapes or extract spectral data from files supported by ESTAMPES.
- **BLS**: Added option `RamanSetup` in the curve specifications to choose the Raman/ROA setup.
- **BLS**: Added option `RamanLaser` in the curve specifications to choose the Raman/ROA incident frequencies.  Alternatively, `RamanWInc` can be used.  The incident frequencies is expected in cm-1.
- **BLS**: A filetype can now be provided to the file parser if the file extensions is ambiguous.
- **BLS**: Ballast can now support multiple files in a single curve, for instance to produce the spectrum of mixtures.  The format is "file1 @ weight1 & file2 @ weight2" (spaces are irrelevant between symbols).
- **MRG**: Mirage was updated to support the new representations of normal modes.
- **MRG**: Mirage now recognizes colors specifications as sub-options of `--vid-model`.
- **VIZ**: A summary of the commands available in the molecular viewer with `MolWin` is now printed by default (can be deactivated with parameter `skip_guide=True` given to constructor).  It can be recalled at any moment with 'CTRL+SHIFT+H' (CMD+SHIFT+H on Mac).
- **VIZ**: `MolWin` can now animate vibrations with 'CTRL+A' (CMD+A on Mac). The animation can be paused and resumed.
- **VIZ**: New method of `Molecule` to control animated atomic displacements, "animate".  While intended for vibrations, it can be used for any kind of displacements.
- **VIZ**: `MolWin` can now export screenshots with 'CTRL+P' (CMD+P on Mac). The export is still experimental and can give offset colors.
- **VIZ**: `MolWin` now supports a new shortcut 'CTRL+E' (COMMAND+E on Mac) to export a POV-Ray file describing the represented in the same orientation (currently translations are not considered).
- **VIZ**: `Molecule`, `VibMode` and `POVBuilder` now support explicit description of the representation model and material.  Old keywords like `rad_atom_as_bond` are deprecated and have been removed.
- **VIZ**: `Molecule` now supports other "materials" (WIP).
- **VIZ**: The description scene in POV-Ray has been changed to match the modified convention.  This way, the interactive viewer and POV-Ray describe by default the same scene.
- **VIZ**: `Molecule` and `VibView` have a new method to retrieve visualization parameters, `viz_options`.
- **VIZ**: Added two new representations of normal modes: as arrows centered on the atoms (midarrows), as dual arrows showing the "positive" and "negative" displacements (dualarrows).
- **LIB**: New module `base.aliases` to provide common aliases for keywords (e.g., spectroscopy, level of theory) regularly used within ESTAMPES.
- **LIB**: The `Spectrum` class can now support multiple datasets and relative weights (for now purely numerical).
- **LIB**: New function `tools.vib.build_vibrations` constructs the normal coordinates vector and frequencies Cartesian force constants.  The function is inspired by the white paper of Gaussian (https://gaussian.com/vib/), transcribed in Python by M. Fus√®.
- **LIB**: New function `tools.vib.convert_hess_evec` can convert mass-weighted eigenvectors to dimensionless eigenvectors and fix the shape of the matrix.
- **LIB**: New function `tools.vib.norm_evec` normalizes each eigenvector.
- **LIB**: New dictionary with X11 RGB colors names available in `data.colors`.
- **LIB**: New module to store color names: `data.colors`.  It currently supports X11, XKCD and the default color palette of Matplotlib.
- **LIB**: New function to parse an option value (for instance in `--arg=value`) of the form "value(option,key=option)".
- **LIB**: New alias `COLOR_NAMES` containing all RGB color dictionaries dictionaries in `data.colors`.
- **LIB**: New conversion function from a color specification to RGB tuple, `data.colors.to_rgb_list`.

- **LIB**: `visual.povrender.write_pov_vib` now fully supports color specifications.
- **LIB**: `visual.vibview.VidMode` now fully supports color specifications.
- **API**: Multi-jobs (explicit or internal linked jobs) in Gaussian log files are now supported.  ESTAMPES assumes that the jobs are all related to the same task (for instance opt+freq) and does not support selective extractions from a specific job (e.g., linked freq jobs with different levels of theory) for now.
- **API**: Added support of anharmonic X matrix from Gaussian log files.

### Fixed
- **BLS**: Fixed the construction of the grid of labels with multiple plots, which led to an IndexError.
- **BLS**: `gen-longini` now displays the comments below and not anymore inline so they can be properly parsed by the INI parser.
- **LIB**: Fixed conversion of "hybrid" Raman/ROA activities in `convert_y`.
- **LIB**: `Spectrum.get_xunit()` and `Spectrum.get_yunit()` could fail if no unit was defined for a given spectrum (for instance with experimental CSV files) and a conversion to LaTeX format was requested.

### Changed
- **LIB**: `spec.convert_y` now returns 3 objects, distinguishing conversions to be applied on values from the X axis and instead on values from the original X values (e.g., Raman/ROA hybrid units).
- **LIB**: `spec.broaden` now supports an additional argument, `xconv`, for conversions specific to X values, that cannot be done using the X axis.
- **LIB**: `Spectrum` now does an approximate search on the incident frequencies if the value in input is truncated to the integer part.
- **API**: Method `dfile.get_hess_data` has been completely rewritten to provide more accurate results by properly projecting out rotations and translations, and avoid code duplication.

### Removed
- **API**: Functions `get_hess_data` in parsers' modules are now deprecated and have been removed.  The `dfile.get_hess_data` method should be used instead or `tools.vib.build_vibrations` for a more general form.

## [0.4.2] - 2022-06-14

### Added
- **API** - **EXPERIMENTAL**: `parser/gaussian/glog` now supports extracting Raman and ROA activity.  Note that because of some peculiarities of Raman and how Gaussian handles it, the parser may still fail in some cases.
- **API** - `parser/gaussian/glog` now fully supports the band assignments of FC calculations.
- **API** - `parser/gaussian/glog` now supports GVPT2 variational coefficients.

- **API** - Added qlabel `Intens:` to extract intensity-related quantities for spectroscopies.
- **API** - Added support of reduced-dimensionality VPT2 in Gaussian log files.  Note that there are limitations on the use: `vtrans` and `vlevels` must be provided together for it to work.
- **VIZ** - Added class `MolWin` (`estampes.visual.molview`) to build a 3D representation of one or more molecules.
- **VIZ** - Added possibility to reverse vertically the normal mode listing for `plot_jmat`, `plot_cmat` and `plot_kvec` with `top_down`.

- **LIB** - Added conversion factor from integrated intensity to molar absorption coefficient for IR in `tools.spec.convert_y`

### Fixed
- **API** - Fixed parser of sub-option for `vptdat` in `parse_qlabel`.
- **API** - `parser/xyz` now properly supports the _qlabels_.
- **LIB** - The translation vector returned by `tools.math.superpose` was not properly mass-weighted.

- **DOC** - Header doc and type hints of `tools.math.superpose`.

### Changed
- **LIB** - `list_bonds` is now part of a dedicated module, `tools.mol`, and not in `visual.molview` to facilitate accesses without the need for Qt libs.
- **LIB** - `convert_labsymb` now fixes the case of the atomic symbol if the conversion is from `str` to `str`.
- **LIB** - Class `Spectrum` uses qlabel `intens:IR` instead or `dipstr` to extract IR intensities, since the later is not systematically available.
- **DEV** - Improved some basic type hints, adding support for Numpy is present.

### Removed
- **API** _ `parser/xyz`: `read_data` does not support anymore the geometry index for files with multiple geometries.  This caused a non-standard behavior of the wrapper, and is partially superseded by the proper support of _qlabels_.  More parameters are accessible by using directly the internal class without passing by the `DataFile` wrapper class.


## [0.4.1] - 2021-07-14

## [0.4.0] - 2021-05-07

### Notice
* This version introduces a number of breaking changes to the library and API.  Updates of external programs are likely necessary.  Be warned:
    * `convert_y` returns a function for the contribution of x to y.
    * `broaden` expects a function (or `None`) to include contributions from x into the definition of y.
    * The internal *qlabel* has changed: the old sub-option is now divided into a quantity-specific option and the level of theory (`H`, `A`).

### Added
- **LIB** - `convert_y` supports sub-options (e.g., incident frequencies for Raman).
- **LIB** - `convert_y` (tools/spec) now supports scaling factors in units.
- **LIB** - New function `property_units` in `data/property` to convert quantities between common unit systems (e.g., SI, cgs).
- **LIB** - New function `convert_expr` in `tools/char` to convert simple "human" mathematical expressions to Python-valid ones.
- **LIB** - New submodule `char` in `tools/` for string-related operations.

### Fixed
- **API** - Scaling factor in unit of electronic rotatory strength extracted from Gaussian log transferred to quantity itself to facilitate conversions.
- **API** - `parse_qlabel` correctly parses the sub-option of `qty_tag=2` (same as `atcrd`).

### Changed
- **DOC** - Added more documentation.  The `doc/` folder has also been reorganized to be clearer.
